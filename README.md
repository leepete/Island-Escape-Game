ISLAND ESCAPE

README																											  
 
	Island Escape is a 3D isometric puzzle game created by Darren Hobern, Nathan Larson, 
	William Judd, Peter Lee and Connor Lindsay for SWEN222 at Victoria University of Wellington.


RULES
	
	The aim of the game is to amass the most points than any other player on the board.
	Points are scored by collecting glowing bubbles. You gain 50 points each bubble. 
	There are traps (Bear Traps and Bombs) available to be picked up and used against other players 
	to slow them down. Stepping on a active trap will lose you points. Coloured keys respond to 
	the same colour door tile so check if you have the correct one. The map consists of different locations
	and finding a torch will prove useful in dark lit areas. Chests are available in fixed locations 
	throughout the map to store items (not keys). Beware, other players can steal from the chests!
	After the end portal is found, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.
	
	Good luck and have fun!
